                  thinking about what composition communicates.
                i put it into words, and it came out as something 
              being presented without a lot of context, but still
              being able to be easily understood. it involves the intuition
              the senses, it is not about placing the answer in the viewer's mouth
              but putting suggestions of ideas in front of them.
              composition can be quite clever! it is about communicating ideas
              through placements, kind of like architecture. 
              <br><br><br>
              the knowledge of aesthetics can be useful to understand how to 
              communicate ideas. i am thinking of how composition is not simply 
              placing random things in decorative fashion, though if that is the purpose
              then it is fine. 
              <br><br><br>
              currently, the composition is in process. the essence is of my younger self as 
              well as present self coming to terms with god, the ecstatic formless, the nameless identity.
              <br><br><br>
              transness is not without my cultural roots, the culture of oppression sanitises diversity, but
              it has always existed!
           <br><br><br>
              i was reading about lalon fakir, and reflecting on the sant mat tradition of syncretic mystical practices.
              <br><br><br>
              it is the syncretic india i belong to, one that doesn't know boundaries. one that translates and transcends and
              is so creative to have so much diversity of ideas, traditions. 
               <br><br><br>
              <i>"Lalon is a spiritual leader, philosopher, mystic poet and social reformer"</i>
              <br><br><br>
              in my composition, i have eyes gazing into a distant formless reality. underneath, are different
              gestures that feel sensual, evocative, nostalgic. i am not sure still what i am communicating!
              <br><br><br>
              i think painting challenges me to dig through the act of making rather than writing.
              so, i think my next actions are to dig through drawing.
              <br><br><br><br><br><br>
              on the mind: treating the process sacredly, and protecting it
                            <br><br><br><br><br><br>

              the instinct for instant validation and gratification is tempting. so i will be extra careful to
              protect my creative child. he deserves to fully actulise itself before she is let out into the word.
              she is for me, to explore all my thoughts and ideas as freely as possible, not within the confines of
              aesthetical critique or exteranal eyes!!
