thinking of the divining of the self. the past is the spiral otherwise in touch with spirits. making this painting amidst the mystical habits of the forest, i am drawn to creatures i cannot see but sense. i am imagining beings that cherished freedom and preciousness, that wrote history for themselves, that divined this forest, the spirits linger, touching the spiral essence of the soul
<br><br><br>
              im enjoying this in between colour of blue and green and turquoise, that is a bit dulled out, i want to include it in the painting. because i was also inspired by the picture of me and mumma both wearing blue, her in a sari and me in a tinker bell dress. and that blue was the same colour sari paavani wore to farwell!! something about it feels precious. 

              <br><br><br>
the being /freak/demon in the painting emerging is inspired by that tinker bell photo. i want it to be a representation of a precious memory of a past i do not know, of the forest, of its life, of its inhabitants that are not longer there, who have been overridden by an obscured, disrespected history, who lived their lives here earnestly, who deserve to treated preciously. i feel their spirits, i feel comforted by their freakishness, something about it feels a resonance with the past physical self too. the fact that i am dressed as a fairy also!! 

              <br><br><br>
next to the mystical being represented by a silhouette of me in a fairy dress, is the formless representation of its essence! the two participate in revolution together. the two are like two snakes intertwined, their meeting creating a new beginning, a formation of mountains and seas and lands of the planet. a becoming of an idea outside of thought: aftan. 

              <br><br><br>
i pay homage to all demon gods, and everything ridiculed, spat on, hurt, disrespected, those are my friends, those are my fond creatures, those are my ancestors. mythology can be so interesting when you rip it off to make it revolutionary

              <br><br><br>
the forest inspires Alternative Mythology.
