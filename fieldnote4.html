to paint, one must eat first. soul food, physical food, ritual food. then one must paint.

              i am lucky to hold the brush. i am lucky to hold the pen. to experience the freeness of time this way.
<br><br><br>
i am thinking of the green in salman toor’s paintings. trying to mimic. i am thinking of the ravan’s court’s painting and the colour palette of it. i am thinking of the other demon painting with the purple, green, red colour palette.

              i just love the geometric compositions and the flow in this. it is very clear and communicative. green goes with red and red goes with blue and green also goes with purple i feel since they all make each other. i like how there is linearity in its flow. left indent of the figures. it is simple and impactful and tells a story with clarity!! in my composition, i feel clarity and simplicity are missing. along the lines “too many distractions not enough actions”.(how do i want to work on this?)

              <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/1afe0834-ba4f-46c2-aafe-9fba12db8403/DP153188.jpg?v=1740935427472">
                          <br><br><br>

              this one is my utmost favourite! what about the composition conveys clarity? the simple and clear boundaries.the use of contrasting colours. blue and yellow always work well together. and then blue and red and green are great. and then there is a pop of a unique purple colour but still maintaining the main palette with surrounding green, yellow, red objects so it is not so out of the ordinary or looks offish. it works!and the colours are divine. shading of the figures is so simple. light main and dark toned tracing to give shadows. 

              <br> <br><br>
              i am leaning towards most following the middle palette. i love doing realistic faces with oil paints so i want there to be a main subject. i don’t want it to be too abstract. i want the subject to evoke demon/ trickster vibes but neither do i want it to be ever mistaken for kri*hna…i was first thinking blue but then remembered. i feel dark tones of green and purple would work great! and with one part of the canvas already having dark toned greens it would be fun to have a purple figure in like neoexpressionist german style. one thing i also like about the middle painting is that there are many pops of colors but they are balanced out by negative space! the white is soothing with all the other demanding colours.
