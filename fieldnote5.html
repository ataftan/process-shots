there is no love without eruption of the whole soul. every encounter, lasts as a reminder of mortality in the truest sense, the pleasure of arriving at a state of impermanence is for how absence translates longing. “the bitter becomes sweet, the sweet becomes bitter”.
<br><br><br>
              i want so spend every moment in love with this impermanent state of desire. loneliness is so generative for the bittersweet! there is a mutuality between the absent and the precious, we may never understand the latter without sensing a gap, an emptiness, its beckoning hollows (Sadiya Hartman).“the archive” is this essence of sense, an understanding of this mutuality and the firm illogic it relies on to come to terms with the creativeness of reality. we amongst many beings different from us, no matter where we are from, what histories we belong to, there is so much we don’t know about each other and the world beyond us! isn’t that so humbling? there are thousands of mythologies, languages, foods, traditions, we are not aware of, simply because it would be quite impossible to know everything. it is so humbling to sit with how creative reality is. cultural diversity is a reflection of biodiversity. the earth has created so many iterations, inter-species, flora and fauna, the deep seas, tiny lands hidden from human eyes, changing seasons– it has been centuries of our species on this planet and we still don’t know it all! given the historical instincts of humans to assert supremacy, i hope the planet protects its biodiversity from us. 

              <br><br><br>
“the archive”, as the self’s understanding of absence and the precious in relation to history, may forever be incomplete. every individual carries so much knowledge, and the only way an archive can present an accurate dimension of our Time here is if each is enabled to participate in it. and a recent lesson has been, not everything can be documented. however, even the earth has ruins, open gravesites, meeting places for the past and present. we have naturally mirrored those in our cultural preservation of this species life. 

              <br><br><br>
ethnography is archival in nature. it presents data, reviews trends, points of changing weathers that led to the present tense. 

              <br><br><br>
“the otherwise” is inaccurate. it is a spiral. a labyrinth of longing, a maze of delights. a precious history. a generative absence. the tensile elasticity between pleasure and pain.
